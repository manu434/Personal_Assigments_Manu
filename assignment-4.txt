### **1. What is the difference between a Primary Key and a Foreign Key?**

| **Aspect**          | **Primary Key**                                              | **Foreign Key**                                             |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**          | Uniquely identifies each row in a table.                    | Creates a relationship between two tables.                 |
| **Uniqueness**       | Must contain unique values for every row.                   | Can contain duplicate values if allowed by the referenced column. |
| **Nullability**      | Cannot contain `NULL` values.                               | Can contain `NULL` values unless specified otherwise.      |
| **Definition**       | Defined on a column or set of columns within the same table.| Refers to a Primary Key in another table.                  |
| **Constraint Type**  | Ensures rows are uniquely identifiable.                     | Enforces referential integrity between tables.             |

### **2. Can a table have multiple Primary Keys? Justify your answer.**

**Answer:**
No, a table cannot have multiple Primary Keys because the purpose of a Primary Key is to uniquely identify a row in a table. Allowing more than one Primary Key would create ambiguity in determining which key uniquely identifies a record.

However, a table can have a **composite Primary Key**, where two or more columns together act as the Primary Key to ensure uniqueness.

### **3. Explain what happens when a Foreign Key constraint is violated.**

**Answer:**
When a Foreign Key constraint is violated:
- **During insertion:** If you try to insert a record in the referencing table with a value that doesnâ€™t exist in the referenced table's Primary Key, the database throws an error and prevents the insertion.
- **During deletion:** If you try to delete a record from the referenced table that is being used by the referencing table, the database throws an error unless cascading or nullifying actions are defined (e.g., `ON DELETE CASCADE`).

### **4. Discuss how `ON DELETE CASCADE` works in the context of Foreign Keys.**

**Answer:**
The `ON DELETE CASCADE` option ensures that when a row in the referenced table is deleted, all related rows in the referencing table are also automatically deleted. This helps maintain referential integrity by removing orphan records.

#### Example:
If there are two tables:
- **`Parent`**: Primary Key is `ParentID`.
- **`Child`**: Foreign Key references `Parent.ParentID` with `ON DELETE CASCADE`.

If you delete a row from the `Parent` table, all rows in the `Child` table referencing that `ParentID` will also be deleted.
