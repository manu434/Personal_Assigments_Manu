//Question: Create a program to manage a Vehicle hierarchy.
//Abstract Class: Vehicle
//
//Attributes: brand (String), year (int)
//Method: showDetails() â€“ Abstract method
//Constructor: Accepts brand and year and initializes them.
//Class Car (inherits from Vehicle)
//
//Additional attribute: fuelType (String)
//Constructor: Accepts brand, year, and fuelType and initializes them.
//Overrides showDetails() to display details of the car.
//Class Bike (inherits from Vehicle)
//
//Additional attribute: engineCapacity (int)
//Constructor: Accepts brand, year, and engineCapacity and initializes them.
//Overrides showDetails() to display details of the bike.
//Main Class: Create objects of both Car and Bike, and call the showDetails() method for each.
